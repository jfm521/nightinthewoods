M:WOW. WE’RE UP REALLY HIGH.
M:AND REALLY FAR OUT!
M:I CAN’T SEE TOWN FROM HERE
A:IT’S SOUTH OF US, BEHIND WHATEVER RIDGE THAT IS.
M:SO WHAT, ARE WE JUST SUPPOSED TO WAIT HERE AND SEE IF ANYTHING HAPPENS?
A:YOU TELL ME! YOU’RE THE EXPERT.
M:I GUESS WE’LL JUST WAIT HERE AND SEE IF ANYTHING HAPPENS.
A:NICE NIGHT.
M:YEAH.
M:BACK AT SCHOOL I COULDN’T SEE AS MANY STARS.
M:THAT ALWAYS MADE ME SAD.
A:OH YEAH. THEY’RE REALLY NICE UP HERE.
M:I WISH I KNEW THE CONSTELLATIONS LIKE YOU DID.
A:WHAT?
M:YOU KNOW ALL THE NAMES AND THE STORIES AND STUFF.
A:I WISH. I CAN NEVER REMEMBER THEM OTHER THAN…
A:I THINK THAT ONE UP THERE IS LIKE A BELL OR SOMETHING?
M:NO. NO NO NO.
M:REMEMBER THAT TIME WE WERE ALL AT THAT LONGEST NIGHT BONFIRE?
M:AND WE SPOTTED THE CONSTELLATIONS TOGETHER
M:AND YOU TOLD US ALL ABOUT THEM???
A:THAT'S NOT A THING THAT HAPPENED.
M:OH WOW. MAYBE IT WAS LIKE A DREAM OR SOMETHING.
M:GOD, I BARELY REMEMBER NOW.
A:I WONDER WHAT FAKE CONSTELLATIONS AND STORIES YOU DREAMED UP.
M:OK, HUMOR ME.
M:I’LL FIND THE CONSTELLATIONS, YOU TELL ME ABOUT THEM.
A:OK THEN.
